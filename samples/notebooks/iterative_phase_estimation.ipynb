    "# Iterative Phase Estimation via the Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample code and notebook was written by members of KPMG Quantum team in Australia. It aims to demonstrate expanded capabilities of targets that support adaptive quantum computing, also known as integrated hybrid computing. It makes use of bounded loops, classical function calls, nested conditional if statements, mid-program measurements and qubit reuse.\n",

    "## Two Dimensional Inner Product Calculation Using Iterative Phase Estimation on Three Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an iterative phase estimation within Q#. It will use iterative phase estimation to calculate an inner product between two 2-dimensional vectors encoded on a target qubit and an ancilla qubit. An additional control qubit is also initialised which will be the only qubit used for measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit begins by encoding the pair of vectors on the target qubit and the ancilla qubit. It then applies an Oracle operator to the entire register, controlled off the control qubit (which is set up in the $\\\\ket +$ state). The controlled Oracle operator generates a phase on the $\\\\ket 1$ state of the control qubit. This can then be read by applying a H gate to the control qubit to make the phase observable when measuring."
