    // We consider a particular family of problems known as hidden
    // shift problems, in which one is given two Boolean functions
    // 𝑓 and 𝑔 with the promise that they satisfy the relation
    //
    //     𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑥 ⊕ 𝑠) for all 𝑥,
    //
    // where 𝑠 is a hidden bitstring that we would like to find.

    // Good quantum algorithms exist for several different families of
    // pairs of Boolean functions. In particular, here we consider the
    // case in which both 𝑓 and 𝑔 are bent functions. We say that
    // a Boolean function is bent if it is as far from linear as
    // possible. In particular, bent functions have flat Fourier spectra,
    // such that each Fourier coefficient is equal in absolute value.

    // In this case, the Roetteler algorithm (see References, below)
    // uses black-box oracles for 𝑓^* and 𝑔, where 𝑓^* is the dual bent
    // function to 𝑓 (defined in more detail below), and computes the
    // hidden shift 𝑠 between 𝑓 and 𝑔.

    /// # Summary
    /// Correlation-based algorithm to solve the hidden shift problem
    /// for bent functions. The problem is to identify an unknown
    /// shift 𝑠 of the arguments of two Boolean functions 𝑓 and 𝑔 that
    /// are promised to satisfy the relation 𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑥 ⊕ 𝑠) for all 𝑥.
    /// Note that the promise about the functions 𝑓 and 𝑔 to be
    /// bent functions is assumed, i.e., they both have a flat Fourier
    // (Walsh–Hadamard) spectra. Input to this algorithm are
    /// implementations 𝑈_g of the Boolean function 𝑔 and 𝑈_f^*,
    /// an implementation of dual bent function of the function 𝑓.
    /// Both functions are given via phase encoding.
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## Ufstar
    /// A quantum operation that implements
    /// $U_f^*: |𝑥〉 ↦ (-1)^{f^*(x)} |𝑥〉$,
    /// where $f^*$ is a Boolean function, 𝑥 is an $n$ bit register
    /// ## Ug
    /// A quantum operation that implements
    /// $U_g:|𝑥〉 ↦ (-1)^{g(x)} |𝑥〉$,
    /// where 𝑔 is a Boolean function that is shifted by unknown
    /// 𝑠 from 𝑓, and 𝑥 is an $n$ bit register.
    /// ## n
    /// The number of bits of the input register |𝑥〉.
    ///
    /// # Output
    /// An array of type `Result[]` which encodes the bit representation
    /// of the hidden shift.

    // We demonstrate this algorithm by defining an operation which
    // implements an oracle for a bent function constructed from the
    // inner product of Boolean functions.

    // In particular, the operation `InnerProductBentFunction`
    // defines the Boolean function IP(x_0, ..., x_{n-1}) which is
    // computed into the phase, i.e., a diagonal operator that maps
    // |x〉 -> (-1)^{IP(x)} |x〉, where x stands for x=(x_0, ..., x_{n-1})
    // and all the x_i are binary. The IP function is defined as
    // IP(y, z) = y_0 z_0 + y_1 z_1 + ... y_{u-1} z_{u-1} where
    // y = (y_0, ..., y_{u-1}) and z =  (z_0, ..., z_{u-1}) are two bit
    // vectors of length u. Notice that the function IP is a Boolean
    // function on n = 2u bits. IP is a special case of a so-called
    // 'bent' function. These are functions for which the Walsh-Hadamard
    // transform is perfectly flat (in absolute value). Because of this
    // flatness, the Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of any bent function
    // defines a +1/-1 function, i.e., gives rise to another Boolean
    // function, called the 'dual bent function'. What is more, for the
    // case of the IP function it can be shown that IP is equal to
    // its own dual bent function, a fact that is exploited in
    // the present test case.

    // Notice that a diagonal operator implementing IP between
    // 2 variables y_0 and z_0 is nothing but the AND function between
    // those variables, i.e., in phase encoding it is computed by a
    // Controlled-Z gate. Extending this to an XOR of the AND of more
    // variables, as required in the definition of the IP function can
    // then be accomplished by applying several Controlled-Z
    // gates between the respective inputs.
