/// # Description
/// Q# uses the `Qubit` primitive type to represent quantum state. A qubit represents
/// the smallest addressable physical unit in a quantum computer. Qubits are long-lived,
/// and accumulates transformations to quantum states. A Q# program has no ability to
/// introspect into the state of a qubit, and thus is entirely agnostic about what a
/// quantum state is or on how it is realized. Rather, a program can call operations
/// such as Measure to learn information about the quantum state of the computation.
