/// # Description
/// Q# allows specialized implementations. Operations in Q# can implicitly
/// or explicitly define adjoint and/or controlled versions.
/// Q# employs symbolic computation that can automatically generate the
/// corresponding adjoint and controlled implementations for a particular 
/// body implementation.
