/// # Sample
/// Repeat-Until Loops
///
/// # Description
/// The repeat-until loop runs a block of code before evaluating a condition.
/// If the condition evaluates to true, the loop exits. If the condition
/// evaluates to false, an optional fixup block is executed before the
/// next loop iteration is run.
///
/// The compiler treats all parts of the repeat-until loop (both blocks and
/// the condition) as a single scope for each repetition. Symbols that
/// are defined within the repeat block are visible both to the
/// condition and within the fixup block. Symbols go out of scope after
/// each iteration, such that symbols defined in the fixup block are not
/// visible in the repeat block.
