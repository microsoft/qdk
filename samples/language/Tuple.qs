/// # Sample
/// Tuple
///
/// # Description
/// A tuple literal is a sequence of one or more expressions of any type,
/// separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses `(` and `)`. The type of
/// the tuple includes the information about each item type.
///
/// Tuples containing a single item are treated as identical to the item
/// itself, both in type and value, which is called singleton tuple equivalence.
