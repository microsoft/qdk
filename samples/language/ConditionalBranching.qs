/// # Sample
/// Conditional Branching
///
/// # Description
/// Q# supports three branching keywords: `if`, `elif`, and `else`. These behave in the normal
/// way, if you're familiar with if expressions or statements in other languages. One key distinction
/// in Q# is that ifs are expressions, not statements. That means that they can return values, and
/// they effectively perform the job of both ternary expressions and if statements in other languages.
/// If expressions allow your code to branch, or conditionally execute parts of a Q# program.
