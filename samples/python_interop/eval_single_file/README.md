# An example of loading and running code from a Q# file

This example shows how the `qsharp` Python package can load and execute a file containing
Q# code.

Most other samples show using a `qsharp.init` call to load a Q# project, or using Q# cells
in Jupyter Notebooks. This example simply reads a Q# file from disk and evaluates it.
