    "1. `introduction.ipynb` — Basic qubits, circuits, and a quantum random number generator.\n",
    "2. `teleportation.ipynb` — Teleportation protocol using primitive operations.\n",
    "3. `custom_gates.ipynb` — Defining and decomposing custom gates for readability.\n",
    "4. `classical_control_and_barriers.ipynb` — Classical feed-forward corrections and enforcing moment boundaries.\n",
    "5. `submission_to_azure.ipynb` — Export Cirq to OpenQASM, compile to QIR, and submit to Azure Quantum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open each notebook in order for a progressive learning experience.\n",

    "> Tip: Run cells incrementally and inspect circuits after each construction step to build intuition about how Cirq schedules operations into moments."
