# An example project to showcase Q# program with a defined folder structure

## Description

The example project demonstrates a Q# quantum teleportation program using a specific folder structure. The directory includes a `qsharp.json` manifest and Q# source files organized into subfolders. The main file, `RunTeleport.qs`, contains the entry point and references operations defined in other files. The teleportation logic is implemented in `Teleport.qs`, which uses a standard operation from `PrepareState.qs` to create a Bell pair. Instructions are provided for running the program in Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, or Python environment.
