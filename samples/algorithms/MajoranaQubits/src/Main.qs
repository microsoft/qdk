/// Majorana Qubits

/// # Description
/// In hardware providing majorana qubits, common quantum operations
/// are implemented using measurements and Pauli corrections. This
/// sample shows a hypotetical hardware provider exposing some custom
/// gates to Q# and a small library built on top of it.

/// Sample program using custom gates from a hardware provider.
