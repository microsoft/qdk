/// # Sample
/// Bit-Flip Code
///
/// # Description
/// This sample demonstrates the three-qubit bit-flip code. This code is a
/// simple quantum error correction strategy for protecting against a single
/// bit-flip error by encoding a logical qubit into three physical qubits. A
/// single bit-flip error is when one of the three physical qubits has its
/// state changed erroneously in a way that is equivalent to applying the X
/// gate to it.
///
/// The bit-flip correction code works by checking the parity of the physical
/// qubits. By measuring only their parity, the quantum superposition of the
/// qubits is preserved. Because all the physical qubits are supposed to have
/// the same state, when the parity checks detect a difference in state, the
/// erroneous qubit can be identified and corrected.
///
/// This Q# program prepares a logical qubit encoded as three physical qubits
/// with one of the qubits being bit-flipped. It then identifies and corrects
/// the flipped qubit.
