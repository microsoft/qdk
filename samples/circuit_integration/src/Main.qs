/// # Description
/// This sample demonstrates the ability to use circuit files in Q# projects.
/// It shows how to import and use custom quantum circuits defined in their own files.
/// The circuit file, JointMeasurement.qsc, contains a joint measurement circuit for three qubits.
/// This circuit file can be opened in VS Code and edited with a visual editor.
/// Here, we import a circuit for performing a joint measurement of three
/// qubits, with one auxiliary qubit. The results of the measurements should always
/// contain 1 or 3 `Zero` results.

import JointMeasurement.JointMeasurement;

/// Sample program using custom gates from a hardware provider.
operation Main() : Result[] {
    use qs = Qubit[4];
    ApplyToEach(H, qs[0..2]);
    let results = JointMeasurement(qs);
    ResetAll(qs);
    results
}
