/**
 * Katas Taxonomy
 *
 * A Kata is a top-level container of educational items (exercises and examples) which are used to explain a particular
 * topic.
 *
 * This file contains the information needed to build the content for all the Katas, and its main purpose is to convey
 * ordering. Each Kata and each item within a Kata  is listed in the order it is meant to be presented to students.
 *
 * Each Kata is organized in a directory where a content.md file is present, and multiple sub-directories. Each
 * sub-directory represents an item within the Kata and its specific content depends on the type of item it represents.
