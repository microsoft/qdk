# Summary
Applies a unitary operation on the target if the control
register state corresponds to a specified nonnegative integer.

# Input
## numberState
A nonnegative integer on which the operation `oracle` should be
controlled.
## oracle
A unitary operation to be controlled.
## target
A target on which to apply `oracle`.
## controlRegister
A quantum register that controls application of `oracle`.

# Remarks
The value of `numberState` is interpreted using a little-endian encoding.

`numberState` must be at most $2^\texttt{Length(controlRegister)} - 1$.
For example, `numberState = 537` means that `oracle`
is applied if and only if `controlRegister` is in the state $\ket{537}$.
---
operation ApplyControlledOnInt<'T>(numberState : Int, oracle : ('T => Unit is Param<1>), controlRegister : Qubit[], target : 'T) : Unit is Adj + Ctl

---

# Summary
Applies a unitary operation on the target,
controlled on a state specified by a given bit mask.

# Input
## bits
The bit string to control the given unitary operation on.
## oracle
The unitary operation to be applied on the target.
## target
The target to be passed to `oracle` as an input.
## controlRegister
A quantum register that controls application of `oracle`.

# Remarks
The pattern given by `bits` may be shorter than `controlRegister`,
in which case additional control qubits are ignored (that is, neither
controlled on $\ket{0}$ nor $\ket{1}$).
If `bits` is longer than `controlRegister`, an error is raised.

For example, `bits = [0,1,0,0,1]` means that `oracle` is applied if and only if `controlRegister`
is in the state $\ket{0}\ket{1}\ket{0}\ket{0}\ket{1}$.
