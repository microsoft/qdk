# MeasureEachZ operation

Namespace: [Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement)

```qsharp
operation MeasureEachZ(register : Qubit[]) : Result[]
```

## Summary
Measures each qubit in a given array in the standard basis.
## Input
### targets
An array of qubits to be measured.
## Output
An array of measurement results.

## Remarks
This operation does not reset the measured qubits to the |0‚ü© state,
leaving them in the state that corresponds to the measurement results.
