# MResetY operation

`operation MResetY(target : Qubit) : Result`

## Summary
Measures a single qubit in the Y basis,
and resets it to a fixed initial state
following the measurement.

## Description
Performs a single-qubit measurement in the Y-basis,
and ensures that the qubit is returned to |0‚ü©
following the measurement.

## Input
### target
A single qubit to be measured.

## Output
The result of measuring `target` in the Pauli Y basis.
