    /// This method allows you to dump information about the current quantum state.

    /// For the local sparse-state simulator distributed as part of the
    /// Quantum Development Kit, this method will write the wave function as a

    /// the amplitudes of the probability of measuring the corresponding state.

    /// # Example
    /// When run on the sparse-state simulator, the following snippet dumps
    /// the Bell state (|00⟩ + |11⟩ ) / √2 to the console:
    /// ```qsharp
    /// use left = Qubit();

    /// This check is implemented by using the Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism to reduce

    /// # Remarks
    /// This operation requires that the operation modeling the expected behavior is
