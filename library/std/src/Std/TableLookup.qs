/// # Summary
/// Performs table lookup using a SELECT network
///
/// # Description
/// Assuming a zero-initialized `target` register, this operation will
/// initialize it with the bitstrings in `data` at indices according to the
/// computational values of the `address` register.
///
/// # Input
/// ## data
/// The classical table lookup data which is prepared in `target` with
/// respect to the state in `address`. The length of data must be less than
/// 2ⁿ, where 𝑛 is the length of `address`. Each entry in data must have
/// the same length that must be equal to the length of `target`.
/// ## address
/// Address register
/// ## target
/// Zero-initialized target register
///
/// # Remarks
/// The implementation of the SELECT network is based on unary encoding as
/// presented in [1].  The recursive implementation of that algorithm is
/// presented in [3].  The adjoint variant is optimized using a
/// measurement-based unlookup operation [4]. The controlled adjoint variant
/// is not optimized using this technique.
