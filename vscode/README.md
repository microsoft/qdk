# Q# Language Support for VS Code

This VS Code extension contains:

- The TextMate grammar and language configuration for Q#. This enables syntax highlighting
  and basic syntactic features (brace matching, etc.).
- Q# cell support in Jupyter Notebooks. The extension will detect `%%qsharp` magic cells
  and automatically update the cell language to Q#.
- Error checking in Q# source files.
- Breakpoint debugging and script execution for Q# source files.

To install locally:

- Build the extension by running `build.py` or `build.py --wasm --npm --vscode` from the repo root.
- Package the `VSIX` with `vsce package` while in the `vscode` directory. To get `vsce`, run `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
- In VS Code, run command "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
- Select the `VSIX` you just packaged (`qsharp.vscode-0.0.0.vsix` for example) in the directory.
- Reload your VS Code window.

This will enable the extension for all instances of VS Code.

To scope the extension to only a specific workspace (for example, the `qsharp` repo):

- In VS Code, find and open the "Q# (new)" extension in the Extensions view.
- Click the "Disable" button to disable the extension globally.
- Click the dropdown next to "Enable" button and select "Enable (Workspace)".

This will enable the extension for only the current workspace. The extension will remain
enabled for that workspace across restarts.
