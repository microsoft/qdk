Recall that we can only observe alterations to out input state by performing a measurement.
If we apply Hadamard gate to the third qubit, we will be able to distinguish between the input state and the output state. 
    $$(I\otimes I \otimes H)|11+\rangle = |110\rangle \\ (I\otimes I \otimes H)|11-\rangle = |111\rangle$$ 
Now if we were to measure the third qubit, we'll be able to distinguish the starting state and the state after phase kickback occurred.
