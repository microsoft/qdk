The binary notation of $7$ is $111_2$. This means that your solution should return `true` if and only if each bit of the input is `true`.

Notice that in this problem the solution doesn't depend on whether the bit string is converted into an integer using 
big endian or little endian notation. In general, this is an important distinction that you need to take into account.
