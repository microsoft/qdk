# Measurements for single-qubit systems

This tutorial introduces you to measurements done on single-qubit systems.
The concept of a measurement is a central part of quantum mechanics,
as well as quantum algorithms. Single-qubit measurements, as their name implies
are measurements on single qubits. The outcomes of a measurement in quantum mechanics
are probabilistic, and in general, change the state of the qubit
depending on the outcome of the measurement.

We recommend to go through the
[tutorial that introduces single-qubit gates](../single_qubit_gates/content.md)
before starting this one.

**This tutorial covers the following topics:**

* Computational basis measurements
* Pauli basis measurements
* Measurements in arbitrary orthogonal bases
* Representing measurements as projector operators
