**The outcome probabilities for a measurement in a specified basis**

1. What are the outcome probabilities of measuring a qubit in the $\ket{0}$ state in the Pauli X basis, i.e., the $\{ \ket +, \ket -\}$ basis?

2. What are the outcome probabilities of measuring a qubit in the $0.6\ket{0} + 0.8 \ket{1}$ state in the Pauli Y basis, i.e., the $\{ \ket i, \ket{-i}\}$ basis?
