## <span style="color:blue">Demo: Measurement statistics</span>

The following cell contains code demonstrating that the theoretical and experimental values of the probability outcomes indeed match with each other. We repeatedly prepare the same state $\ket \psi = 0.6 \ket 0 + 0.8 \ket 1$ and measure it in the computational basis $100$ times. At the end, we expect $0$ to be measured approximately $36$ times, and $1$ to be measured approximately $64$ times. Note that since measurements are probabilistic, we do not expect the results to match these values exactly.
