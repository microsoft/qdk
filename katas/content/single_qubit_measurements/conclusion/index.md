## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned enough to try solving the first part of the [Measurements kata](../../Measurements/Measurements.ipynb). 
When you are done with that, you can continue to the next tutorial in the series to learn about [measurements for multi-qubit systems](../MultiQubitSystemMeasurements/MultiQubitSystemMeasurements.ipynb).
