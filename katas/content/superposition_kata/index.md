# Superposition Kata

@[section]({
    "id": "superposition__overview",
    "title": "Overview"
})

This kata is designed to get you familiar with the concept of superposition and with Q# programming.

**This kata covers the following topics:**

- Using basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates to prepare quantum states
- Manipulating superposition states
- Flow control and recursion in Q#

**What you should know to start working on this kata:**

- Dirac notation for single-qubit and multi-qubit quantum systems
- Basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates
