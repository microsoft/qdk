The first thing we notice is that, unlike in the previous task, we cannot represent this state as a tensor product of two individual qubit states - this goal state is NOT separable.

Let's see what steps we can take to prepare this state without factoring it into states of individual qubits.

First, we notice that we should end with a superposition of two of the four computational basis for two qubits: $|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle, |11\rangle$.

This gives us a hint that we should start by preparing a superposition on at least one of the qubits. Letâ€™s try creating a superposition on the first qubit with a Hadamard gate: 

$$H|0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt2} (|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \otimes |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt2} (|00\rangle + |10\rangle)$$

Well, we got pretty close, except we need to transform the $|10\rangle$ state to $|11\rangle$.
How can we do this? 

We can take advantage of controlled gates, specifically the [controlled NOT gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate), also referred to as $CNOT$. This gate acts on two qubits, hence it is represented as a $4 \times 4$ unitary matrix. The $CNOT$ gate changes the target qubit from state $|0\rangle$ to $|1\rangle$ and vice versa when the control qubit is $|1\rangle$ and does nothing to the target qubit when the control qubit is $|0\rangle$. The control qubit always remains unchanged. 

$$\text{CNOT} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

If we apply the CNOT gate to the state $\frac{1}{\sqrt2} (|00\rangle + |10\rangle)$, taking the first qubit as the control and the second one as target, we'll get exactly the desired goal state. 
 
Steps required to reach goal state:
1. Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit.
2. Applying a CNOT with first qubit as control and second qubit as target.

In matrix representation we can represent this operation as a product of two $4 \times 4$ matrices, with the matrix corresponding to the first step being the tensor product of a Hadamard gate on the first qubit and identity gate on the second qubit.

$$H \otimes I = \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1  \\\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  \\\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = 
\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\underset{\text{CNOT}}{\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}}} 
\cdot 
\underset{H \otimes I}{\underbrace{\frac{1}{\sqrt2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}}}
\cdot
\underset{|0\rangle}{\underbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 0 \\\ 0 \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}}}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 0 \\\ 0 \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
= \underset{goal}{\underbrace{ \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 0 \\\ 0 \\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}}}
\label{6.1} \tag{6.1}
$$

Note that in the matrix representation and in Dirac notation the gates are applied from right to left (the rightmost operation happens firts), while in circuit notation the operations are applied from left to right (the leftmost operation happens first).
