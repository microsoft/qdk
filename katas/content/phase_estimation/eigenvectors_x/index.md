**Input:** None.

**Output:** Return an array of two eigenvectors of the $X$ gate that correspond to different eigenvalues.

$$X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

The eigenvectors don't have to be normalized, that is, they don't have to describe valid quantum states.
Both eigenvectors have to be non-zero.

> In this task, the eigenvectors are represented as arrays of Q# `Double` type of length $2$. Your return should be an array of two such arrays.
