**Sequential measurements on an entangled state and a separable state**
Consider two two-qubit states:
- The Bell state $|\Phi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big (|00\rangle + |11\rangle\big)$.
- A state $\ket \Theta = \frac{1}{2} \big( \ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10} + \ket{11} \big)$.

For both states, consider a measurement on the first qubit, followed by a measurement on the second qubit, both done in the computational basis. For which state can we expect the measurement outcomes to be correlated? Verify by calculating the sequential measurement probabilities explicitly for both states.
