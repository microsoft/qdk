### <span style="color:blue">Exercise 6</span>: Sequential measurements on an entangled state and a separable state
Consider two two-qubit states:
- The Bell state $|\Phi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big (|00\rangle + |11\rangle\big)$.
- A state $\ket \Theta = \frac{1}{2} \big( \ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10} + \ket{11} \big)$.

For both states, consider a measurement on the first qubit, followed by a measurement on the second qubit, both done in the computational basis. For which state can we expect the measurement outcomes to be correlated? Verify by calculating the sequential measurement probabilities explicitly for both states. 

*Can't come up with a solution? See the explained solution in the [Multi-Qubit System Measurement Workbook](./Workbook_MultiQubitSystemMeasurements.ipynb#Exercise-6:-Sequential-measurements-on-an-entangled-state-and-a-separable-state).*

> Congratulations! You have learned enough about the measurements to start solving problems from the [Measurements kata](../../Measurements/Measurements.ipynb)!
You can give them a try and return to the rest of this tutorial later, or keep reading.
