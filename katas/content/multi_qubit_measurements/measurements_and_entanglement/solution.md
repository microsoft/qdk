- *The Bell state*: If the measurement outcome on the first qubit is $0$, a subsequent measurement on the second qubit *always* results in an outcome of $0$, with probability $1$. Similarly, if the measurement outcome on the first qubit is $1$, then the second qubit measurement always results in $1$. Thus, sequential measurements are perfectly *correlated*.
- *Separable state* $\ket \Theta$: Irrespective of whether the first qubit measurement outcome is $0$ of $1$ (each of which occurs with a probability of $0.5$), a subsequent measurement on the second qubit results in an outcome of $0$ or $1$ (both with a probability of $0.5$). Thus, sequential measurements are perfectly *uncorrelated*.  

This aligns with the fact that the Bell state is entangled, while the $\ket{\Theta}$ is separable and can be expressed as $\ket \Theta = \ket + \otimes \ket +$.
