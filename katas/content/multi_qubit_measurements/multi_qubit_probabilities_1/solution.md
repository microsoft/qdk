The wave function $|\psi\rangle$ is normalized, since $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = 1$. Hence, the probabilities of measuring each of the computational basis states is simply the square of the absolute value of the corresponding coefficients. That is, the probabilities of measuring $00$, $01$ and $11$ are $\frac{1}{9}$, $\frac{4}{9}$ and $\frac{4}{9}$, respectively, and the probability of measuring the basis state $10$ that is not part of the superposition is $0$:
