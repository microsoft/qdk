**Multi-qubit measurement outcome probabilities II**

Suppose that a two-qubit system is known to be in the following state:
$$\ket \psi =  \frac{2}{3}\ket {00} + \frac{1}{3} \ket {01} + \frac{2}{3}\ket {11}$$

If all the qubits are measured simultaneously in the Pauli X basis, i.e., in the $\{ \ket{++}, \ket{+-}, \ket{-+}, \ket{--}\}$ basis, what are the outcome probabilities?
