**Partial measurement probabilities for the Hardy state**

Consider a 2-qubit system in the state $\ket \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \big(3|00\rangle + |01\rangle + |10\rangle + |11\rangle\big)$.

If only the first qubit is measured in the computational basis, what are the probabilities of the outcomes, and the post-measurement states of the system?
