**Inputs:**

1. A qubit in the $|0\rangle$ state.
2. Angle $\alpha$, in radians, represented as `Double`.

**Goal**: Change the state of the qubit to $\cos{α} |0\rangle + \sin{α} |1\rangle$.

  <summary><b>Need a hint?</b></summary>
  Experiment with rotation gates you learned about in the Single-Qubit Gates kata.
  Note that all rotation operators rotate the state by <i>half</i> of its angle argument.
