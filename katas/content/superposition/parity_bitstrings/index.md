**Inputs:**
1. $N$ ($N \ge 1$) qubits in the $|0 \dots 0\rangle$ state.
2. An `Int` `parity`.

**Goal:** Change the state to an equal superposition of all basis states that have
* an even number of 1s in them if `parity = 0`, or
* an odd number of 1s in them if `parity = 1`.

**Example:**

For $N = 2$ the required state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(|00\rangle + |11\rangle\big)$ if `parity = 0`, or $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(|01\rangle + |10\rangle\big)$ if `parity = 1`.
