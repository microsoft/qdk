**Input:** $N = 2^k$ qubits in the $|0 \dots 0\rangle$ state.

**Goal:**  Change the state of the qubits to the [W state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_state) - an equal superposition of $N$ basis states on $N$ qubits which have Hamming weight of 1.

**Example:**

For $N = 4$ the required state is $\frac{1}{2}\big(|1000\rangle + |0100\rangle + |0010\rangle + |0001\rangle\big)$.
