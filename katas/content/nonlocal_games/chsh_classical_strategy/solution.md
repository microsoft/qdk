If Alice and Bob always return TRUE, they will have a $75\%$ win rate, since TRUE $\oplus$ TRUE == FALSE, and the AND operation on their input bits will be FALSE with $75\%$ probability.
Alternatively, Alice and Bob could agree to always return FALSE to achieve the same $75\%$ win probability. A classical strategy cannot achieve a higher success probability.
