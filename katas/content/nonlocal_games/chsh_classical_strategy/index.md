In this task you have to implement two functions, one for Alice's classical strategy and one for Bob's. 
Note that they are covered by one test, so you have to implement both to pass the test.

**Input:** 
Alice and Bob's starting bits (X and Y).

**Output:**
  Alice and Bob's output bits (A and B) to maximize their chance of winning.
