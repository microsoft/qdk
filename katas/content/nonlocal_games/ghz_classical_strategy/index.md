In this task you have to implement three functions, one for each player's classical strategy.
Note that they are covered by one test, so you have to implement all of them to pass the test.
For non-deterministic strategies, DrawRandomBoolean or [DrawRandomInt](https://learn.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp-lang/microsoft.quantum.random/drawrandomint) functions from Q# library can be used.

**Inputs:**

Alice, Bob, and Charlie's starting bits (X, Y, and Z).

**Goal:**

Alice, Bob, and Charlie's output bits (A, B, and C) to maximize their chance of winning.
