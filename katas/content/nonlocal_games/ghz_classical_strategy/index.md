In this task you have to implement three functions, one for each player's classical strategy.
Note that they are covered by one test, so you have to implement all of them to pass the test.
In each function, the input is the starting bit of the corresponding player, and it should return the output bit chosen by that player.

**Input:**

Alice, Bob, and Charlie's starting bits (R, S, and T).

**Output:**

Alice, Bob, and Charlie's output bits (A, B, and C) to maximize their chance of winning.
