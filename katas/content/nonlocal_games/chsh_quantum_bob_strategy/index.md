**Input:**

- Bob's starting bit (Y)
- Bob's half of Bell pair he shares with Alice.

**Goal:**
Measure Bob's qubit in the $\frac{\pi}{8}$ basis if his bit is 0 (false), or the $-\frac{\pi}{8}$ basis if his bit is 1 (true), and return the result.
The state of the qubit after the operation does not matter.
