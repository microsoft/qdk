In the quantum version of the game, the players still can not communicate during the game, but they are allowed to share
qubits from an entangled triple before the start of the game.

**Input:**
An array of three qubits in the $\ket{000}$ state.

**Goal:**
Create the entangled state $\ket{\Phi} = \frac{1}{2} \big(\ket{000} - \ket{011} - \ket{101} - \ket{110} \big)$ on these qubits.

>This state is equivalent to the three-qubit [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state)
>$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{000} + \ket{111} \big)$$
>up to local unitary operations. Please refer to the follow-up GHZ Quantum Strategy discussion for details.
