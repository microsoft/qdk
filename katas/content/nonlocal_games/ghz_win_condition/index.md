**Inputs:**

1. Alice, Bob and Charlie's input bits (r, s and t), stored as an array of length 3,
2. Alice, Bob and Charlie's output bits (a, b and c), stored as an array of length 3.
The input bits will have zero or two bits set to true.

**Output:**
True if Alice, Bob and Charlie won the GHZ game, that is, if r ∨ s ∨ t = a ⊕ b ⊕ c, and false otherwise.
