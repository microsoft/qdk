**Inputs:**

1. Alice, Bob and Charlie's input bits (r, s and t), stored as an array of length 3.
   The input bits will have zero or two bits set to true.
2. Alice, Bob and Charlie's output bits (a, b and c), stored as an array of length 3.

**Goal:**

True if Alice, Bob and Charlie won the GHZ game, that is, if R $\lor$ S $\lor$ T = A $\oplus$ B $\oplus$ C, and false otherwise.
