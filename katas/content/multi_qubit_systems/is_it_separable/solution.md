Let's assume that this state is separable and write down the system of equations to determine the coefficients of individual qubit states in the tensor product, similar to what we did in the previous exercise:

$$
\begin{cases}
\alpha\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \\\ \alpha\delta = 0 \\\ \beta \gamma = 0 \\\ \beta \delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt2}
\end{cases}
$$

Now let's multiply the first and the last equations, and the second and the third equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
\alpha\beta\gamma\delta = \frac{1}{2} \\\ \alpha\beta\gamma\delta = 0
\end{cases}
$$

We can see that this system of equations doesn't have a solution, which means that this state is **not separable**.
