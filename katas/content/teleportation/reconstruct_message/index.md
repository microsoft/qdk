Transform Bob's qubit into the required state using the two classical bits received from Alice.

**Inputs:** 
1. Bob's part of the entangled pair of qubits `qBob`.
2. The tuple of classical bits received from Alice, in the format used in previous exercise.

**Goal:** 
Transform Bob's qubit `qBob` into the state in which the message qubit had been originally.
