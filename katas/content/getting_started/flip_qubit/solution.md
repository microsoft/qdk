Once you've successfully implemented a solution or if you're stuck on a problem, you can consult the reference solution, which contains additional details on how to solve the exercise.

For this exercise, you can solve the problem by simply using Q#'s `X` operation on the input qubit, which will perform a "bit flip" and set the qubit into the $\ket{1}$ state.
