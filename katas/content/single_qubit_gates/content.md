# Single-Qubit Gates

This tutorial introduces you to single-qubit gates. Quantum gates are the quantum counterpart to classical logic gates, acting as the building blocks of quantum algorithms. Quantum gates transform qubit states in various ways, and can be applied sequentially to perform complex quantum calculations. Single-qubit gates, as their name implies, act on individual qubits. You can learn more at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate).

We recommend to go through the [tutorial that introduces the concept of qubit](../Qubit/Qubit.ipynb) before starting this one.

This tutorial covers the following topics:
* Matrix representation
* Ket-bra representation
* The most important single-qubit gates

A quick summary of the gates can also be found in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/blob/main/quickref/qsharp-quick-reference.pdf).
