A global phase is a phase factor that multiplies the entire quantum state. It is not observable when measuring the qubit's state, as the probabilities remain unchanged. However, it is significant when considering quantum state transformations.

Our task is to implement an operation that transforms the given qubit state from $|\psi\rangle = \beta |0\rangle + \gamma |1\rangle$ to $- \beta |0\rangle - \gamma |1\rangle$.

To do that, we utilize a sequence of gates. The Pauli Z gate followed by the Pauli X gate can be used to achieve this effect when applied in succession twice.

1. **Apply the Pauli Z gate**: The Z gate multiplies the $|1\rangle$ state by $-1$ but does not change the $|0\rangle$ state, converting our state $\beta |0\rangle + \gamma |1\rangle$ to $\beta |0\rangle - \gamma |1\rangle$.

   The matrix representation of the Z gate is:

   $$
   Z =
   \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
   $$

2. **Apply the Pauli X gate**: The X gate flips the $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ basis states, converting our $\beta |0\rangle - \gamma |1\rangle$ state to $\beta |1\rangle - \gamma |0\rangle$.

   The matrix representation of the X gate is:

   $$
   X =
   \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\1 & 0\end{bmatrix}
   $$

3. **Repeat the Z and X gates**: Applying the Z gate again will multiply the $|1\rangle$ state (that used to be $|0\rangle$), converting our state $\beta |1\rangle - \gamma |0\rangle$ to $- \beta |1\rangle - \gamma |0\rangle$. Finally, the second X gate will restore the original basis states, but now with both amplitudes having acquired an additional phase of $-1$. This means our state has been multiplied by $-1$, achieving the required global phase change.
