**Input:** A qubit which is guaranteed to be in either the $\ket{0}$ or the $\ket{+}$ state.
    
**Output:**  `true` if the qubit was in the $\ket{0}$ state, or `false` if it was in the $\ket{+}$ state. The state of the qubit at the end of the operation does not matter.

In this task your solution will be called multiple times, with one of the states picked with equal probability every time. You have to get overall accuracy of at least 80%.

> This task is an example of quantum hypothesis testing, or state discrimination with minimum error.
