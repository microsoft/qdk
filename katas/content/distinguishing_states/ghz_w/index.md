**Input:** $N \ge 2$ qubits (stored in an array of length $N$) which are guaranteed to be either in the [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) or in the [W state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_state).

**Output:**
* 0 if the qubits were in the GHZ state,
* 1 if they were in the W state.

The state of the qubits at the end of the operation does not matter.
