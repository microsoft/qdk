**Input:** 
$N$ qubits (stored in an array of length $N$) which are guaranteed to be either in the $\ket{0...0}$ state or in the [W state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_state) state (an equal superposition of all basis states that have exactly one $\ket{1}$ in them).

**Output:**
* 0 if the qubits were in the $\ket{0...0}$ state,
* 1 if they were in the W state.

The state of the qubits at the end of the operation does not matter.
