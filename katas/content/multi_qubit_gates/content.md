# Multi-Qubit Gates

This tutorial continues the introduction to quantum gates started in [this tutorial](../SingleQubitGates/SingleQubitGates.ipynb), focusing on applying quantum gates to multi-qubit systems.

If you need a refresher on the representation of multi-qubit systems, we recommend you to review the [relevant tutorial](../MultiQubitSystems/MultiQubitSystems.ipynb).

This tutorial covers the following topics:

- Applying quantum gates to a part of the system
- $\\text{CNOT}$ and $\\text{SWAP}$ gates
- Controlled gates
