# The Qubit
This tutorial introduces you to one of the core concepts in quantum computing - the qubit, and its representation in mathematical notation and in Q# code.

This tutorial assumes familiarity with complex arithmetic and linear algebra.

This tutorial covers the following topics:
* The concept of a qubit
* Superposition
* Vector representation of qubit states
* Dirac notation
* `Qubit` data type in Q#"
