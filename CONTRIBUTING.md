# Contributing to Q#

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Q# and the Quantum Development Kit!

## Asking and Answering Questions

Have a question? The `q#` tags on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/q%23) and [Quantum Computing StackExchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/q%23) are great places to ask questions about Q#, Quantum Development Kit and quantum computing in general.
You can learn more about our work on the [Q# Development Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/) and ask questions in the comments as well.
Your question will server as resource to others searching for help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the Quantum Development Kit?
Have a feature request?
We want to hear about it!

You can follow the [template](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) for reporting issues on this repository.

## Contributing Code

If you are interested in helping fix issues you or someone else encountered,
please make sure that the corresponding issue has been filed on the repository.
Check that nobody is currently working on it and that it has indeed been marked as bug.
If that's the case, indicate on the issue that you are working on it,
and link to the corresponding GitHub page where the fix is being developed.
If someone is already working on a fix, ask if you can help or see what other things can be done.
If an issue is labeled as feature, please follow the guidelines related to contributing features.
Sometimes it may take a couple of days for us to label issues appropriately.
If an issue has not been labeled yet, please indicate that you would like to work on it and be patient -
we are a small team and are doing our best to be quick with responding to your inquiry!

**Note:**
Issues related to the design and evolution of the Q# language are marked with
[Area-Language](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AArea-Language).

If you are interested in contributing a new feature,
please first check if a similar functionality has already been requested.
If so, consider contributing to the discussion around it rather than filing a separate issue.
If no open or closed issue with such a request already exists,
please file one following the [feature request template](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=).
We will respond to feature requests and follow up with a discussion around its feasibility,
how one might go about implementing it, and whether that is something we would consider adding to our repo.
We might not be able to eventually merge even a great feature for one reason or another.
Even if we are not able to incorporate something into the packages and extensions we distribute,
we encourage you to pursue your passion project in your own fork,
and share and discuss your thoughts and progress on the corresponding issue.

If you are looking for a place to get started with contributing code,
search for example for the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [help-wanted](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/labels/help%20wanted) labels.
Also, look for issues that have already been discussed in more detail,
and check if you can help someone who has already started working on it.

And last but not least:

# Thank You!
